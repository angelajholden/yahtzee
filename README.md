# Template :pineapple:

This is a template to start new projects.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:angelajholden/template.git

npm install
```

## Heroku Ready!

This can be easily deployed to Heroku as a `php` app.

```php
<?php
/*
To deploy static HTML projects, we need to let Heroku think this is a PHP app
If you don't need this, delete index.php and change the name of home.html to index.html
*/
include_once('home.html');
?>
```
